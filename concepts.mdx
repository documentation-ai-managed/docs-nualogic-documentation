## AI Basics for Business

AI analyzes data to predict outcomes and automate decisions. You use machine learning models to forecast sales or detect fraud. NuaLogic tailors models like regression for Irish retail SMEs.

## Process Automation Fundamentals

Automation streamlines workflows using tools like RPA (Robotic Process Automation). You integrate scripts to handle invoice processing or customer onboarding.

## Role of Fractional CIO

A fractional CIO provides part-time strategic tech leadership. You gain C-suite insights on AI adoption without hiring full-time. NuaLogic's experts align IT with Dublin SME growth plans.

## Ethical AI Implementation

Prioritize fairness, transparency, and privacy. You audit models for bias and comply with GDPR. Ethical practices prevent reputational risks.

Use serverless architectures for cost efficiency.

<CodeGroup tabs="Python,Node.js">
```python
# AWS Lambda for scalable inference
import boto3
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
response = lambda_client.invoke(FunctionName='ai-model')
```
```javascript
// Node.js serverless function
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const lambda = new AWS.Lambda();
const params = { FunctionName: 'ai-model' };
lambda.invoke(params, (err, data) => { console.log(data); });
```
